## 1. Machine Learning
In this repo, files contain in `ML` directory is the final architecture that most suitable with our project. We have done several research and development to build this project model. To see in more details, please visit this [repository](https://github.com/samleonnn/HerAi-Model-Development).

Tasks for Machine Learning team:
- [x] Collecting and Cleaning Dataset
- [x] Build Model
- [x] Train and Test Model
- [x] Model Deployment in Android Application
- [x] Test Model in Production

Several references and sources as follows are use in collecting the dataset:
- [Waste Classification data by SASHAANK SEKAR](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data)
- [waste_pictures by 且听风吟](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wangziang/waste-pictures)
- [Most Common Recyclable and Non-Recyclable Objects by ASHWIN SHRIVASTAV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwinshrivastav/most-common-recyclable-and-nonrecyclable-objects)
- [Garbage Classification (12 classes) by MOSTAFA MOHAMED](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification?select=garbage_classification)

As result, our dataset contains:
- `Organic` category: `7,249` Train images + `1,475` Validation images
- `Recyclable` category: `7,000` Train images + `2,626` Validation images
- `Non-Recyclable` category: `7,000` Train images + `2,324` Validation images
